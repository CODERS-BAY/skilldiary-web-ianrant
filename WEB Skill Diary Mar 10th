## TUESDAY, March 10th

__KNOWLEDGE GAINED:__
* I reserched and applied quite a number of code snippets and HTML properties to get ahead with my JS games (such as the "step" property for an input box of type "number"
* and a lot of trial and error working with with JS functions, HTML forms and processing the data

__IMPROVEMENT/INSIGHT NEEDED:__
* I still have to make up for all the Bootstrap lessons and praciticing missed - I hope to get there by mid next week
